            <p class="text-animate">
                Some think Mardi Gras may be linked with the ancient Roman pagan celebrations of spring and fertility
                such as Saturnalia, which dates back to 133–31 BC. This celebration honored the god of agriculture,
                Saturn. It was observed in mid-December, before the sowing of winter crops. It was a week-long festival
                when work and business came to a halt. Schools and courts of law closed, and the normal social patterns
                were suspended. On the Julian calendar, which the Romans adopted in 45 BC, the winter solstice fell
                on December 25. Hence, the celebration gradually became associated with Christmas.

                <p style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">LaToya Cantrell is the Mayor of New
                    Orleans in Louisiana. Cantrell assumed office in 2018. Cantrell's current term ends on January 10,
                    2022.
                    Cantrell is running for re-election for Mayor of New Orleans in Louisiana.
                    Cantrell is on the ballot in the primary on October 9, 2021.
                    <br>
                    Cantrell rose to local prominence through her work to recover and restore the Broadmoor neighborhood
                    following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In 2012, she won a special election for the New Orleans City
                    Council to serve a partial term. Cantrell was elected to a full term in 2014, where she sponsored a
                    measure prohibiting smoking in city bars and casinos.[1]

                    In her first term as mayor, Cantrell was involved in negotiations to secure $50 million for the
                    Sewerage & Water Board. She also established a four-phase reopening plan for New Orleans during the
                    coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

                    New Orleans</span></h3>
            <p class="text-animate2">
                While not observed nationally throughout the United States, a number of traditionally ethnic
                French
                cities and regions in the country have notable celebrations. Mardi Gras arrived in North America
                as a
                French Catholic tradition with the Le Moyne brothers, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and
                Jean-Baptiste
                Le Moyne de Bienville, in the late 17th century, when King Louis XIV sent the pair to defend
                France's
                claim on the territory of Louisiane, which included what are now the U.S. states of Alabama,
                Mississippi, Louisiana and part of eastern Texas.

                The expedition, led by Iberville, entered the mouth of the Mississippi River on the evening of 2
                March
                1699, Lundi Gras. They did not yet know it was the river explored and claimed for
                France by
                René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1683. The party proceeded upstream to a place on the
                east
                bank about 60 miles (100 km) downriver from where New Orleans is today, and made camp. This was
                on 3
                March 1699, Mardi Gras, so in honour of this holiday, Iberville named the spot Point du Mardi
                Gras
                (French: "Mardi Gras Point") and called the nearby tributary Bayou Mardi Gras.Bienville
                went on to
                found the settlement of Mobile, Alabama in 1702 as the first capital of French Louisiana. In
                1703
                French settlers in Mobile established the first organised Mardi Gras celebration tradition in
                what was
                to become the United States. The first informal mystic society, or krewe, was
                formed in
                Mobile in 1711, the Boeuf Gras Society. By 1720, Biloxi had been made capital of Louisiana.
                The
                French Mardi Gras customs had accompanied the colonists who settled there.


                Knights of Revelry parade down Royal Street in Mobile during the 2010 Mardi Gras season.
                In 1723, the capital of Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718. The first Mardi
                Gras
                parade held in New Orleans is recorded to have taken place in 1837. The tradition in New Orleans
                expanded to the point that it became synonymous with the city in popular perception, and
                embraced by
                residents of New Orleans beyond those of French or Catholic heritage. Mardi Gras celebrations
                are part
                of the basis of the slogan Laissez les bons temps rouler ("Let the good times roll"). On Mardi Gras Day,
                the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the last parades of the
                season wrap
                up and the celebrations come to a close with the Meeting of the Courts (known locally as the Rex
                Ball).
                Other cities along the Gulf Coast with early French colonial heritage, from Pensacola, Florida;
                Galveston, Texas; to Lake Charles and Lafayette, Louisiana; and north to Natchez, Mississippi
                and
                Alexandria, Louisiana, have active Mardi Gras celebrations.
