                        Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="faq-text">
                        No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not
                        believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official"
                        Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products
                        or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the
                        government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
                        merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras
                        celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                    <p class="faq-text">
                        The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi
                        Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                        Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through
                        Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few
                        years.

                        What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="faq-text">
                        The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it
                        will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your
                        clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                        somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then
                        you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                    </h3>
                    <p class="faq-text">
                        The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is
                        the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
                        streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers.
                        If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days
                        to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
                        Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and
                        seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                        Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="faq-text">
                        By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of
                        us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going
                        to every parade, because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags
                        (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys,
                        stuffed animals, beads and more.

                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                        anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon,
                        since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of
                        St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching
                        position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't
                        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the suburban areas like
                        Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday
                        before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                        It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why
